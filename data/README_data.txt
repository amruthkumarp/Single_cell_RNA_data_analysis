# Data Information

## Dataset Source
This tutorial uses data from:

Nanduri et al. (2022)  
"Epigenetic regulation of white adipose tissue plasticity and energy metabolism by nucleosome binding HMGN proteins"  
Nature Communications, 13(1): 4991.  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32643-8

## Study Description
The study examined the role of **HMGN proteins** (HMGN1 and HMGN2) in regulating white adipocyte browning and energy metabolism.  
The experiment compared:
- **Wild-type (WT)** mice and cells  
- **Double knockout (DKO)** mice and cells (lacking HMGN1 and HMGN2)

across **two time points**:
- **Day 0:** preadipocyte state  
- **Day 6:** differentiated adipocytes  

Each condition had **two biological replicates**, resulting in a total of **8 samples**:
| Timepoint | Condition | Replicates |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Day 0 | WT  | 2 |
| Day 0 | DKO | 2 |
| Day 6 | WT  | 2 |
| Day 6 | DKO | 2 |

## Data Type
- Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)
- Processed data used  were count matrices generated from 10x Genomics pipelines.

## Data Access
Raw and processed data are publicly available under the GEO accession: **GSE193462**
